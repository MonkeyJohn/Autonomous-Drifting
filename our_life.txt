eval usage of camera and mouse to compare and to ensure that it works; needs to be done scientifically
compare using a CV method as a baseline, then maybe add some noise to see how well the algorithm adjusts to that


Position
---------
-> IMU = Drift Problem
-> Mouse = Not fast enough, no quick changes
-> PX4Flow = 

XBee
----
-> Memory overflow; memory usage fix
-> Sync vs. Async

Car
---
-> Voltage surge
-> BEC screw up
->

PILCO
-----
-> Random init led to Suboptimal policy

DQN
---
-> Discrete actions


-------------------------------------------------------------

-> Used DQN for init
-> Tried to make car standalone instead of using motion capture
